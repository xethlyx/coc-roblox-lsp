-- 			*funcname	built-in function (see |functions|)

-- 			varname		internal variable (see

-- 					for |curly-braces-names|, |Dictionary|
-- 					entries, |List| items, etc.  Beware
-- 					that evaluating an index may cause an

-- 			:2match		The |:2match| command.
-- 			:3match		The |:3match| command.
-- 			#event		autocommand defined for this event
-- 			#event#pattern	autocommand defined for this event and
-- 					pattern (the pattern is taken

-- 			#group		autocommand group exists
-- 			#group#event	autocommand defined for this group and

-- Returns the text that is displayed for the closed fold at line

-- 		When there is no closed fold at {lnum} an empty string is
-- 		returned.

--- @return string

-- Return a |List| with the lines starting from {lnum} to {end}
-- 		(inclusive) in the buffer {expr}.  If {end} is omitted, a
-- 		|List| with only the line {lnum} is returned.
--
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
--
-- 		For {lnum} and {end} "$" can be used for the last line of the
-- 		buffer.  Otherwise a number must be used.
--
-- 		When {lnum} is smaller than 1 or bigger than the number of
-- 		lines in the buffer, an empty |List| is returned.
--
-- 		When {end} is greater than the number of lines in the buffer,
-- 		it is treated as {end} is set to the number of lines in the
-- 		buffer.  When {end} is before {lnum} an empty |List| is
-- 		returned.
--
-- 		This function works only for loaded buffers.  For unloaded and
-- 		non-existing buffers, an empty |List| is returned.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let lines = getbufline(bufnr("myfile"), 1, "$")
--- @return list

-- The result is the value of option or local buffer variable

-- 		When {varname} is empty returns a dictionary with all the
-- 		buffer-local variables.
-- 		When {varname} is equal to "&" returns a dictionary with all
-- 		the buffer-local options.
-- 		Otherwise, when {varname} starts with "&" returns the value of
-- 		a buffer-local option.
-- 		This also works for a global or buffer-local option, but it
-- 		doesn't work for a global variable, window-local variable or
-- 		window-local option.
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
-- 		When the buffer or variable doesn't exist {def} or an empty
-- 		string is returned, there is no error message.

-- 		locations and the current position in the list.  Each
-- 		entry in the change list is a dictionary with the following
-- 		entries:
-- 			col		column number
-- 			coladd		column offset for 'virtualedit'
-- 			lnum		line number
-- 		If buffer {expr} is the current buffer, then the current
-- 		position refers to the position in the list. For other

--- @return list

-- 			4	control
-- 			8	alt (meta)
-- 			16	meta (when it's different from ALT)
-- 			32	mouse double click
-- 			64	mouse triple click
-- 			96	mouse quadruple click (== 32 + 64)
-- 			128	command (Macintosh only)
-- 		Only the modifiers that have not been included in the
-- 		character itself are obtained.  Thus Shift-a results in "A"
-- 		without a modifier.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.getcharmod() end

-- Return the current character search information as a {dict}
-- 		with the following entries:
--
-- 		    char	character previously used for a character

-- 				if no character search has been performed
-- 		    forward	direction of character search; 1 for forward,

-- 		    until	type of character search; 1 for a |t| or |T|
-- 				character search, 0 for an |f| or |F|
-- 				character search

-- Send keystrokes {keys} to terminal {buf}.

-- 			14   cyan
-- 			15   white
--
-- 		These colors are used in the GUI and in the terminal when

-- When exiting Vim or trying to close the terminal window in

-- 		terminal then the callback function for that part is not used.
--
-- 		There are extra options:
-- 		   "term_name"	     name to use for the buffer name, instead

-- 		   "term_finish"     What to do when the job is finished:
-- 					"close": close any windows
-- 					"open": open window if needed
-- 				     Note that "open" can be interruptive.
-- 				     See |term++close| and |term++open|.

-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use
-- 				     "exit".  A CR is always added.
-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.
-- 		   "tty_type"	     (MS-Windows only): Specify which pty to

--

-- 		the current item.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:call map(mylist, '"> " . v:val . " <"')
-- <		This puts "> " before and " <" after each item in "mylist".
--
-- 		Note that {expr2} is the result of an expression and is then

--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it is called with two arguments:
-- 			1. The key or the index of the current item.
-- 			2. the value of the current item.
-- 		The function must return the new value of the item. Example
-- 		that changes each value by "key-value": >
-- 			func KeyValue(key, val)
-- 			  return a:key . '-' . a:val
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call map(myDict, function('KeyValue'))

-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call map(myDict, {key -> 'item: ' . key})
-- <		If you do not use "key" you can use a short name: >

--
-- 		If the optional {filtered} flag is set to 1, then 'wildignore'
-- 		is applied to filter the results.  Otherwise all the matches
-- 		are returned. The 'wildignorecase' option always applies.
--
-- 		If there are no matches, an empty list is returned.  An

-- 		arbitrary number that can only be used to compare to the
-- 		attribute at other positions.

-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant] ~
--  		The "curswant" number is the preferred column when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  Also see |getpos()|.
--

--  			let save_cursor = getcurpos()
--  			MoveTheCursorAround
--  			call setpos('.', save_cursor)
-- <		Note that this only works within the window.  See

-- Return {text} as a String where any character in {mask} is
-- 		removed from the beginning and  end of {text}.
-- 		If {mask} is not given, {mask} is all characters up to 0x20,
-- 		which includes Tab, space, NL and CR, plus the non-breaking
-- 		space character 0xa0.
-- 		This code deals with multibyte characters properly.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			echo trim("   some text ")
-- <		returns "some text" >
-- 			echo trim("  \r\t\t\r RESERVE \t\n\x0B\xA0") . "_TAIL"
-- <		returns "RESERVE_TAIL" >

-- 		the function by reference, not by name.  This matters when the

-- 		Also for autoloaded functions. {name} cannot be a builtin

-- 		used.  Like what is used for the Normal highlight group
-- 		|hl-Normal|.
-- 		With an argument a check is done whether {name} is a valid
-- 		font name.  If not then an empty string is returned.
-- 		Otherwise the actual font name is returned, or {name} if the
-- 		GUI does not support obtaining the real name.
-- 		Only works when the GUI is running, thus not in your vimrc or
-- 		gvimrc file.  Use the |GUIEnter| autocommand to use this
-- 		function just after the GUI has started.
--- @return string

-- Restore typeahead that was saved with a previous |inputsave()|.
-- 		Should be called the same number of times inputsave() is
-- 		called.  Calling it more often is harmless though.
-- 		Returns 1 when there is nothing to restore, 0 otherwise.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.inputrestore() end

-- The result is a String, which is the read, write, and execute
-- 		permissions of the given file {fname}.
-- 		If {fname} does not exist or its directory cannot be read, an
-- 		empty string is returned.
-- 		The result is of the form "rwxrwxrwx", where each group of
-- 		"rwx" flags represent, in turn, the permissions of the owner
-- 		of the file, the group the file belongs to, and other users.
-- 		If a user does not have a given permission the flag for this
-- 		is replaced with the string "-".  Examples: >
-- 			:echo getfperm("/etc/passwd")
-- 			:echo getfperm(expand("~/.config/nvim/init.vim"))
-- <		This will hopefully (from a security point of view) display
-- 		the string "rw-r--r--" or even "rw-------".
--
-- 		For setting permissions use |setfperm()|.

-- 		When {expr} is a |List| the number of items in the |List| is
-- 		returned.

-- 		When {expr} is a |Dictionary| the number of entries in the
-- 		|Dictionary| is returned.
-- 		Otherwise an error is given.
