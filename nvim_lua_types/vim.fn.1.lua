-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first

-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant]
--
-- 		"bufnum" is the buffer number.	Zero can be used for the

-- 		used for the mark position.  For other marks it specifies the
-- 		buffer to set the mark in.  You can use the |bufnr()| function
-- 		to turn a file name into a buffer number.
-- 		For setting the cursor and the ' mark "bufnum" is ignored,
-- 		since these are associated with a window, not a buffer.
-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
-- 		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
-- 		mark position it is not used.
--
-- 		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in
-- 		the marks to be effectively be swapped, so that '< is always
-- 		before '>.
--
-- 		Returns 0 when the position could be set, -1 otherwise.
-- 		An error message is given if {expr} is invalid.

-- 			since |v:true| and |v:false| were introduced.
-- 		integer	|List| with four numbers: sign (-1 or 1), highest two
-- 			bits, number with bits from 62nd to 31st, lowest 31
-- 			bits. I.e. to get actual number one will need to use

-- 				           & (_VAL[2] << 31)
-- 				           & _VAL[3])
-- <			Special dictionary with this type will appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output under one of the following
-- 			circumstances:
-- 			1. |Number| is 32-bit and value is either above
-- 			   INT32_MAX or below INT32_MIN.
-- 			2. |Number| is 64-bit and value is above INT64_MAX. It
-- 			   cannot possibly be below INT64_MIN because msgpack
-- 			   C parser does not support such values.
-- 		float	|Float|. This value cannot possibly appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output.
-- 		string	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if string contains
-- 			zero byte or if string is a mapping key and mapping is
-- 			being represented as special dictionary for other
-- 			reasons.
-- 		binary	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if binary string
-- 			contains zero byte.

-- 		All NUL characters are replaced with a NL character.
-- 		When {binary} contains "b" binary mode is used:

-- 		- No CR characters are removed.
-- 		Otherwise:
-- 		- CR characters that appear before a NL are removed.

-- 			<slnum>		sourced script line number or function
-- 					line number
-- 			<sflnum>	script file line number, also when in

-- 			<cword>		word under the cursor

-- 			:r		root (one extension removed)
-- 			:e		extension only
--
-- 		Example: >

-- <		Note that when expanding a string that starts with '%', '#' or
-- 		'<', any following text is ignored.  This does NOT work: >
-- 			:let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
-- <		Use this: >
-- 			:let doeswork = expand("%:h") . ".bak"
-- <		Also note that expanding "<cfile>" and others only returns the
-- 		referenced file name without further expansion.  If "<cfile>"
-- 		is "~/.cshrc", you need to do another expand() to have the
-- 		"~/" expanded into the path of the home directory: >
-- 			:echo expand(expand("<cfile>"))
-- <
-- 		There cannot be white space between the variables and the
-- 		following modifier.  The |fnamemodify()| function can be used
-- 		to modify normal file names.
--
-- 		When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
-- 		is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
-- 		buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
-- 		'/' added.
--
-- 		When {expr} does not start with '%', '#' or '<', it is
-- 		expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
-- 		'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional

-- 		limited.
-- 		The result is the String returned by the function.  If the

-- 		If the function returns a number, use libcallnr()!
-- 		If {argument} is a number, it is passed to the function as an
-- 		int; if {argument} is a string, it is passed as a

--
-- 		libcall() allows you to write your own 'plug-in' extensions to
-- 		Vim without having to recompile the program.  It is NOT a
-- 		means to call system functions!  If you try to do so Vim will
-- 		very probably crash.
--
-- 		For Win32, the functions you write must be placed in a DLL
-- 		and use the normal C calling convention (NOT Pascal which is
-- 		used in Windows System DLLs).  The function must take exactly
-- 		one parameter, either a character pointer or a long integer,
-- 		and must return a character pointer or NULL.  The character
-- 		pointer returned must point to memory that will remain valid
-- 		after the function has returned (e.g. in static data in the
-- 		DLL).  If it points to allocated memory, that memory will
-- 		leak away.  Using a static buffer in the function should work,
-- 		it's then freed when the DLL is unloaded.
--
-- 		WARNING: If the function returns a non-valid pointer, Vim may
-- 		crash!	This also happens if the function returns a number,
-- 		because Vim thinks it's a pointer.
-- 		For Win32 systems, {libname} should be the filename of the DLL
-- 		without the ".DLL" suffix.  A full path is only required if
-- 		the DLL is not in the usual places.
-- 		For Unix: When compiling your own plugins, remember that the
-- 		object code must be compiled as position-independent ('PIC').

--
-- 		When {flags} is "rf": Deletes the directory by the name
-- 		{fname} and everything in it, recursively.  BE CAREFUL!
